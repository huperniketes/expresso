 *
 * Header file for the expression evaluator.
 *
 * Expresso is an interactive command-line tool for evaluating expressions.
 * Expresso supports basic data types (integers, characters, strings),
 * literals, operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison, bitwise, string
 * manipulation), and nested expressions using C syntax (e.g., precedence,
 * parentheses). Key constraint: No mutable state—every input is a pure
 * expression that evaluates to an immutable value.

# expresso Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First
Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries

### II. CLI Interface
Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

### IV. Code Quality
Code must be clear, maintainable, and efficient. All contributions will be measured against these standards through code reviews and static analysis. Rationale: High-quality code reduces bugs, lowers maintenance costs, and accelerates future development.

### V. Testing Standards
Comprehensive and automated testing is mandatory. This includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure functionality and reliability. Rationale: Rigorous testing is the foundation of a stable and trustworthy system.

Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas

### VI. User Experience Consistency
A cohesive and predictable user interface and interaction model must be maintained across the entire project. Rationale: Consistency improves usability and reduces the learning curve for new users.

### VII. Performance Requirements
The system must meet defined and measurable performance benchmarks. Performance testing is required for any change that may impact speed or resource consumption. Rationale: A high-performance system is critical for user satisfaction and scalability.

### VIII. Observability
### IX. Versioning & Breaking Changes

### X. Simplicity
Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles

## Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc.
All code incorporated in this project is written in ANSI C17.
CMake is used to create the build system for contributors and users to install and use locally.
compliance standards, deployment policies, etc.

## Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc.
Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.

### Governance Rules
All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE](TBD) for runtime development guidance

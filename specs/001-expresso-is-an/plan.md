# Implementation Plan: Expresso: Interactive Expression Evaluator

**Branch**: `001-expresso-is-an` | **Date**: 2025-10-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-expresso-is-an/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of an interactive command-line tool for evaluating mathematical and logical expressions. The core of the tool will be an expression evaluation library written in ANSI C17. The parser for the expression language will be generated by ANTLR4 with a C++ target, which will be integrated into the C17 application. The project will be built using CMake.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: ANSI C17 (Core application), C++17 (for ANTLR-generated parser)
**Primary Dependencies**: ANTLR4 (Parser Generator)
**Storage**: N/A (In-memory evaluation)
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: C/C++ testing framework for a CMake project]
**Target Platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows (CLI)
**Project Type**: Single project (Library + CLI)
**Performance Goals**: < 50ms average evaluation time
**Constraints**: Immutable expressions (no assignments or pointers)
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user interactive CLI tool

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Library-First**: **PASS**. The evaluator will be a self-contained library.
- **II. CLI Interface**: **PASS**. The primary interface is a CLI.
- **III. Test-First**: **PASS**. TDD is a required part of the implementation phase.
- **V. Testing Standards**: **PASS**. The plan includes unit and integration testing.
- **X. Simplicity**: **VIOLATION**. The use of two different languages (C and C++) introduces complexity.
- **Additional Constraints**: **VIOLATION**. The constitution states "All code... is written in ANSI C17," but the plan requires C++ for the ANTLR parser.

The violations are justified in the Complexity Tracking section below.

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow the "Single project" structure. The `src` directory is divided into `cli` (the user-facing application), `core` (the main C17 library), and `parser` (the C++ ANTLR components). This separation isolates the different languages and concerns.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Use of C++ in a C17 project | The ANTLR4 parser generator, specified in the initial requirements, does not have an ANSI C target. C++ is the most mature and well-supported target that can be cleanly integrated with a C application. | Writing a robust expression parser by hand is a significantly more complex and error-prone task than using a mature tool like ANTLR. The maintenance overhead of a manual parser would be much higher. |
